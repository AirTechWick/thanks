      the live preview for THETA cameras too slow. in Swift, live preview is \
      calculated in the file /OpenSphericalCamera/LivePreviewDelegate.swift. \
      LivePreviewDelegate evaluates about 1 million bytes. The solution is to \
      check the first 2 bytes and the last 2 bytes. This approach lets you do \
      about 100 comparisons, instead of 1 million. Fernando contributed his code back to the community.",
