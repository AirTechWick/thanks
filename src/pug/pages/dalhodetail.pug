    "DalHo and his team at TeeVR is building a handheld indoor scanner using \
    THETA Z1. They are using the USB API to live stream. In testing the API, \
    they discovered that an Image Stitching API command can be set to \
    no-stitching (dual-fisheye). The feature was added in the latest Z1 \
    firmware update (ver 2.10.3 â€“ released 2022-05-31) but the RICOH \
    documentation about this feature was not updated (0xD834 Image Stitching 3).",
