      they discovered that an Image Stitching API command can be set to \
      no-stitching (dual-fisheye). The feature was added in the latest Z1 \
      firmware update (ver 2.10.3 â€“ released 2022-05-31) but the RICOH \
      documentation about this feature was not updated (0xD834 Image Stitching 3).",
