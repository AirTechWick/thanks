      "details": "Laszlo is developing a mobile wireless streaming application \
      for RICOH THETA that will allow people to better view museums \
      and public spaces. His THETA plug-in is available on the RICOH \
      THETA Plug-in Store. He has significantly improved the speed of \
      the wireless mobile plug-in, which can stream live 360 video \
      to an RTMP server like YouTube directly from THETA Z1. Setup \
      is done through his flow.tours site. He is currently improving \
      his plug-in and has added the ability to access log output, \
      which is turned off in plug-in development by default. He has \
      also shown how to set permissions for THETA X plug-in development. \
      X is different from Z1 and V because you canâ€™t use Vysor to set permissions.",
