      "details": "Hugues has developed a commercial sewer robot that using live streaming \
      and recorded 360 video from a robot that traverses sewer pipes to do \
      inspections. He\â€™s contributed multiple solutions in the theta360.guide \
      forums. After extensive testing, he made fixed gphoto2 to be able to \
      change the shutter speed on the Theta V. Hugues also contributed his \
      technique of getting the RTSP stream from THETA and send it in rtp to \
      Janus Gateway. Janus Gateway, running on a Raspberry Pi, transforms the \
      RTP stream and distributes it to HTML5 clients (tested on both FireFox and \
      Chrome) with webRTC. Thank you, Hugues!",
